# LISA-for-Analysis-of-Circadian-Data

**joshuamoore97/LISA_Analysis_of_Plant_Circadian_Data.m:**
Contains the MATLAB code for the analysis presented in each of the figures. 

**Running the analysis:**
To run the analysis you must first download the LISA_Analysis_of_Plant_Circadian_Data.m file and place in an appropriate directory. 
The associated dataset for this study can be found at: https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/data-from-spontaneous-spatiotemporal-waves-of-gene-expression-from-biological-clocks-in-the-leaf-wenden-toner-et-al-pnas-2012-109-67576762(904f8897-1eda-4737-a3fa-e5e08f078a49).html. On this website leaves 16 and 20 can be downloaded from the 'BW-detached_LL-LL_#20' and 'CCA1_LL-LL_#16' links, respectively.
Once the files have been downloaded and placed in the same directory as the .m file, please select one from the dataset by modifying the 'leaffile' variable.
